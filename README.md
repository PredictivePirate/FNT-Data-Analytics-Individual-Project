# FNT-Data-Analytics-Individual-Project


                                        Project Description: Individual Analytics Assignment
In this analytics assignment, I worked with Rahim, the owner of a specialty food store, to analyze a sample dataset of 150 sales transactions over a 30-day period. The assignment aimed to apply descriptive analytics, build a regression model to predict sales, and effectively communicate the findings to Rahim, who has no background in analytics.

For Question 1, I conducted descriptive analytics by calculating statistical measures like mean, median, and others. This analysis provided insights into sales patterns and trends during the 30-day period. To enhance understanding, I created informative charts such as histograms, box plots, and time series plots to visualize key patterns and relationships within the data. I also addressed issues and outliers, ensuring the analysis's integrity.

Moving to Question 2, I focused on developing a regression model for sales prediction. I utilized scatter charts to visualize relationships between the dependent variable (sales) and independent variables. Regression analysis allowed me to select the most suitable model based on statistical metrics like R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and coefficient significance. I justified my model choice, eliminated less predictive variables, and offered suggestions for model improvement, such as collecting additional relevant data or incorporating new variables.

For Question 3, I explained the results of the recommended model to Rahim using non-technical language and visual aids. I highlighted key findings and provided actionable insights for Rahim's business decisions, including inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns. The aim was to empower Rahim to leverage the model's predictions effectively, even without prior analytics knowledge.

Overall, this project encompassed descriptive analytics, regression modeling, and clear communication of findings to a non-technical stakeholder. It provided practical insights and recommendations for Rahim's specialty food store based on data analysis, enabling informed decision-making.
